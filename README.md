# Firepower_O365_Feed_Parser

This is a script that parses the XML feed that Microsoft publishes with URL, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. These addresses are used for the infrastructure of the Microsoft cloud applications (Office 365). The script will parse the XML file into 3 separate TEXT files. Those can be used to create network objects in Firepower.

## Getting Started with the Installation

These instructions will enable you to download the script and run it, so that the output can be used in Firepower as a network object.
